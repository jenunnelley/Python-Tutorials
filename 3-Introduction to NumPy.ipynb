    "Before we look at specific details of the NumPy package, it is important to understand its motivation. NumPy was developed to support scientific computations via the efficient implementation of a multi-dimensional array. In addition to an efficient array implementation, NumPy also includes functions for performing operations on NumPy arrays that are optimized for computational efficeincy. The following code block illustrate the substantial increas in efficiency that NumPy provides in comparison to a standard python list. Specifically, the example considers the task of adding two vectors of a specified size using both standard Python lists and NumPy arrays. The time of the addition, and the size of the resulting objects are reported for comparison purposes.\n",

The <i>del(my_var)</i> can take multiple arguments. For example, <i>del(my_var1, my_var2)</i> deletes the Python variables named <i>my_var1</i> and <i>my_var2</i>.
