The ancestor of NumPy, Numeric, was originally created by Jim Hugunin with contributions from several other developers. In 2005, Travis Oliphant created NumPy by incorporating features of the competing Numarray into Numeric, with extensive modifications. NumPy is open-source software and has many contributors.\n",

    "2. The second common import expression takes the form **from mypackage import mysubmodule**. This statement imports a specific submodule from a package named *mypackage*. Since there is no alias, this type of import will bring in the functions specified in the submodule as they are writtin. For example, if the submodule *mysubmodule* includes a function called *myfunction*, we would call *myfunction* using the syntax `myfunction(*args)`, where `*args` is a placeholder for any function arguments.\n",

    "#### Motivation for NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we look at specific details of the NumPy package, it is important to understand its motivation. NumPy was developed to support scientific computations via the efficient implementation of a multi-dimensional array. In addition to an efficient array implementation, NumPy also includes functions for performing operations on NumPy arrays that are optimized for computational efficeincy. The following code block illustrate the substantial increas in efficiency that NumPy provides in comparison to a standard python list. Specifically, the example considers the task of adding two vectors of a specified size using both standard Python lists and NumPy arrays. The time of the addition, and the size of the resulting objects are reported for comparison purposes.\n",

For example, <i>del(my_var)</i> deletes a Python variable named <i>my_var</i>, freeing any computer memory that was being used to store the variable. The <i>del(my_var)</i> can take multiple arguments. For example, <i>del(my_var1, my_var2)</i> deletes the Python variables named <i>my_var1</i> and <i>my_var2</i>. If you pass an argument to <i>del(my_var)</i> that does not correspond to an existing Python object, an error will be raised.\n",

    "In addition to performing computations on each element of an array, NumPy also allows users to perform aggregations accross all elements and to perform computations along a particular array *axis*. Before continuing, it is important to understand exactly what is meant by an *array axis*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In NumPy, *axes* are defined for arrays with more than one dimension. For example, a 2-dimensional array has two axes: the first running vertically downwards across rows (axis 0), and the second running horizontally across columns (axis 1). Another way to think about this is if I have an $mxn$ array, where $m$ is the number of rows and $n$ the number of columns, the first axis, axis 0, runs across the $m$ rows and the second axis, axis 1, runs across the $n$ columns. \n",
